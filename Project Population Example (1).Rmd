To prevent possible crime and security incidents, we aim to maximize the allocation of security officers to the Portland regions with higher crime. Since we're limited by the number of officers, our objective is to distribute the officers effectively across all regions. The objective function can be a simple summation of officers allocated because we will manage the allocation limits through constraints.

Allocation Limits: For each region, the number of officers allocated should not exceed the maximum number based on the crime score proportion.
If Ci is the crime score of region i and Ctotal is the total crime score, and O is the total number of officers, the max number of officers for region i will be Ci divided by C total multipled by O. The constraint for each regions will be xi less than Ci/Ctotal * O

\text{Max }\sum_{i} x_i&&\text{[Allocates all personnel] }\\
\ \frac{Count_i}{Count_{\text{total}}} \times O -1 \leq x_i \leq \frac{Count_i}{Count_{\text{total}}} \times O +1 &&\text{[Porportional constraint for each region with upper and lower bounds] }\\
\sum_{i} x_i \leq O &&\text{[Cannot exceed total officers] }\\
\sum_{i} x_i = O &&\text{[All available officers must be allocated] }\\
x_i \geq O &&\text{[Non-negativity constraint] }\\
